I've decided to give [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) a chance, and so far I'm enjoying it far more than [Drupal](https://drupal.org/). While a content management framework is great, I've always found that there is far too much bloat for it to be used as a blogging platform. On top of that, [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a fantastic language, and being able to easily write beautiful code through it is extremely enticing.

Only time will tell if this results in me posting more frequently, but I'm optimistic.
